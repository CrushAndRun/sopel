Game description:
**********

Uno is a fun and simple card game to play. Each player is dealt 7 cards and 1
card is laid out on the table. You can only play a card if it matches the face
value or color of the card.

Examples:

-If a green 2 is on the table, you can play a green card or a card with 2 on it.
-If a red draw 2 is on the table, you can play a red card or a card with draw 2
on it.

Card values are 0-9. There are also special cards that can be played.

R = Reverse: Changes the rotation of the player turns.
S = Skip: Skips the next player.
D2 = Draw 2: Makes the next player draw 2 cards and skips their turn.

There are 2 wild cards as well. When used, a player can pick another color for
the next player to use. These are useful if you do not have a card or, in the
case of draw 4, to get revenge on someone.

W = Wild: Allows a player to change the color to Red, Green, Yellow, or Blue.
WD4 = Wild Draw 4: Allows a player to change the color to Red, Green, Yellow, or
Blue. Forces the next player to draw 4 cards and skips their turn.
